# Mobile numeric calculator and school grade calculator

## Description
Mobile calculator developed in the Mobile Development subject at UFRN. The app is divided by fragments that represents the two of its features.

### Numeric Fragment
The numeric fragment acts like a real and normal calculator. You can do any of the main math operations.

### School Grade Fragment 
The school grade fragment does an arithmetic mean with the user entry and shows if the user passed or not on the subject. If there's only the first entry, the app calculates how much you need in the other two grades. The same goes when you only have 2 grades as an entry.
